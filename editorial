This question can be solved by simple geometry and some computations.
If we have the third vertex(i.e. vertex above x axis) and let it be (x,y) then the other two vertex can be calculated by using simple geometry.Let the other two vertex be (l,0) and (r,0) then l=x-y and r=x+y and its hypotenuse is equal to r-l.
Now to solve this problem,for each of the N points we have to find the coordinates of two vertices of the triangle(i.e. the two vertices on the x axis) such that the point in consideration is the third vertex(i.e. point above x axis) of that triangle because this triangle will have the minimum area that contains it. After doing this we will get (li,0) and (ri,0) for each point where i=[1,n].
The hypotenuse of the triangle which is required to contain all points is just the difference between maximum value of r minus the minimum value of l which can be calculated by maintaining min and max variable over the for loop.
If this value is odd than that means that triangle coordinates are not integers(using geometry). Hence we have to increment hypotenuse by 1 if it is odd else hypotenuse is same.
The final area of triangle can be calculated as (hypotenuse/2)^2(using geometry).
